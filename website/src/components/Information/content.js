	intro: `Welcome to this honours computing project, where an advanced facial age classification model has been developed for self-checkouts' initial age verification process. Trained on the UTKFace dataset and leveraging ResNet50 as a base model, the system predicts age based on facial features.`,
	body: `With an impressive accuracy of 95.52% in classifying minors, the model demonstrates the potential of machine learning for performing age verification tasks with precision and efficiency.`,
