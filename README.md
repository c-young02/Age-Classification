## About The Project

![Screenshot](website/public/images/site.png)

Welcome to the Age Classification repository! This project is a culmination of my efforts as part of my honours computing program, where I set out to create a sophisticated age classification model specifically designed for facial analysis. Harnessing the power of machine learning, the model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accuracy and inclusivity in age predictions.
